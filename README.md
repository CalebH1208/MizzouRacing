## How to update the site with your changes.
1. **Initialize Git**  
If you haven't already initialized Git in your project, run this command to start version control in your project directory:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Add the Remote Origin:**  
Add the repository URL as the remote origin:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/aidanPuricelli/mizzou-racing.git
   ```
3. **Check Git Status**  
Check the status of your repository to see which files have changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
4. **Stage Your Changes**  
Add the changes to the staging area (all modified files):
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
5. **Commit Your Changes**  
Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what changes you made"
   ```
6. **Push Your Changes**  
Push the changes to the main branch of the repository:
