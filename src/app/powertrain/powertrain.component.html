      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        We run a Honda CBR600RR engine. Our Powertrain/Drivetrain 
        system contains a custom intake, exhaust, fuel cell, dry 
        sump oil system, and pneumatic shifting system. Our team 
        designs and manufactures all of these components in house. 
        We test and tune the various components on our chassis 
        dynamometer, as well as on track.
