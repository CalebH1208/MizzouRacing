  <h1>Our History</h1>
  <p style="line-height: 30px;">
    Our team was founded in 1985. We resided in our basement shop of Naka Hall (Engineering Building West) from 1998-2022. That shop saw generations of cars and Mizzou Racers come and go. In 2022, we moved into our new shop in Lafferre Hall. We were joined by newly founded Mizzou Electric Racing shortly after and together, we manufactured Mizzou's very first Formula SAE Electric Vehicle.

    Mizzou Racing Alumni have gone on to work at companies like Tesla, Honda, Garmin, SpaceX, Bosch, and Lucid. We have an extensive network of alumni who have accomplished some amazing feats due to their time on Mizzou Racing.
