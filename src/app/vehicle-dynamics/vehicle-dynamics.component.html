      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        Our suspension and chassis subteams make up the vehicle dynamics 
        team. We design and manufacture components in house with our manual 
        and CNC machines. Some highlights of our suspension package are KW 
        V5 dampers, adjustable anti-roll bars, and carbon fiber rods. The 
        team adjusts the toe and camber for events to maximize performance 
        through extensive testing.

            Aaron is a senior mechanical engineering major. He joined 
            the team in the fall of 2021, and served in roles such as 
            Brakes & Controls lead, and president. Aaron has been studying 
            suspension geometry and chassis design while updating the 
            components on the cars. His goals for the year inculde a rear 
            strucutre update, upright redesign, tire models, and data 
            acquistion to make on track adjustments.
